<p>You gave me faith coz you believed. You stood by me and i stood tall. Oh I hope that it wont end though How do I get you alone and I was going to tell you tonight And now it chills me to the bone How do I get you. You have come to show you go on Near far wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door And youre here in my heart And my heart will go on and on Love can touch us one time And last for a lifetime And never let go til were gone Love was when I loved you One true time I hold to In my life well always go on.
