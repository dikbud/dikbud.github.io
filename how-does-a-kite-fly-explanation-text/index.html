<p>The kite rises because currents of air moving parallel to the ground strike the face of the kite and force it backward. At the point when wind goes over the kites surface it is part into two surges of air. The lifting force of all kites is produced by deflecting the air downward the resulting change in momentum producing an upward force. The longer the line the more air resistance it has therefore the lower the flight of the kite. When wind travels over the surface of the kite it is split into two streams of air. I know I should fall if I tried to fly Try said the big kite.</p>
