<p>Create your own opinionTheyre quite similar guitars and I really like the Sound of both of. The Martin DRS2. Fuji X T-30DRS1 - All SapeleDRS2 - Sitka TopSapele BS. The Martin DRS2 is an acoustic-electric D readnought model in the R oad S eries at the 2 nd tier which means it has a solid Sitka spruce top to go along with the solid sapele back and sides of beautiful ribboned grain. The DRS1s punchy lows make it an excellent choice for miked recording when youve got thicker tracks to work with. Audio recorded with a Rode NT-5 direct to disk.</p>

<p>Every Martin Drs2 review will tell you that the Martin Drs2 guitar works as an acoustic and electric guitar. It is going to withstand the test of time and it looks amazing.

My 2 cents however. The multi-laminate Rust Stratabond used to construct the neck of the DRS2 is in keeping with Martins pioneering use of sustainable materials in guitar manufacturing.</p>
