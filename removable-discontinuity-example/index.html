<p><strong>Removable Discontinuity Example</strong>. The first way that a function can fail to be continuous at a point a is that but f a is not defined or f a L. So one example function that contains both kinds of discontinuity is. X2 x 12 8fx x2 2x 15 sin x 10. A removable discontinuity is the subtraction of a point.</p>

<p>The simplest type is called a removable discontinuity. The other types of discontinuities are characterized by the fact that the limit does not exist. This is the currently selected item. F a is not defined If f a is not defined the graph has a hole at a f a. This does not imply that the limit exists but it is the case in this example. F has a removable discontinuity at a if and only if lim xa f x exists but f is not continuous at a.</p>

<p>Removable discontinuities are so named because one can remove this point of discontinuity by defining an almost everywhere identical function of the form 2 which necessarily is everywhere- continuous. This is the currently selected item. In a removable discontinuity the function can be redefined at a particular point to make it continuous. Informally the graph has a hole that can be plugged For example f x x1 x21 f x x 1 x 2 1 has a discontinuity at x 1 x 1 where the denominator vanishes but a look at the plot shows that it can be filled with a value of 12 1 2.
