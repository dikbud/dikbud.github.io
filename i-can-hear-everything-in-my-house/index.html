<p>You can hear them openingclosing their kitchen presses clearing their dishes unplugging things moving clotheshangers etc. My last houses wall were not this bad. I just bought a house. The back bedroom guestroom is the worst you can hear everything. To help you narrow it down the person you hear is going to fall in one major category - someone who has been in your house and knows the lay out of the land.</p>

<p>If the tv isnt on sometimes with it on you can hear them talking and laughing. Neighbours plugging a plug into a socket. Additionally they may also be connected structurally allowing sound to be physically transmitted through the studs and drywall. We also have tile and wood floors throughout our house. Whenever Im in my kitchen at the same time as they are I turn the range on so I dont hear them but it is a little bit annoying and loud in the morning.</p>

<p>Neighbours plugging a plug into a socket. But i have a security camera n my house and several times i have had audio footage come back of my gf coming into the room and entering the closet talking to someone who i have never seen but u can clearly hear her and the others talking. We can hear the neighbours talking to each other and worse. If you hear strange noises like scratching and possibly chittering coming from places where no one lives in the house you could have mice squirrels raccoons or even bats sharing. Voices seem to be amplified and with a slight echo.</p>

<p>When I was young I thought It had to do with the house we lived in but I got married and it has happened in every place we have lived. Certainly some of the sounds you hear in your house are totally normal your fridge intermittently running the occasional creak of the house settling but. A while back we had just gotten to bed and I heard music and talking. Neighbours plugging a plug into a socket. Skittering sounds squeaks buzzes and other noises coming from your walls and attic may mean theres something living in your house that isnt part of your family.</p>
