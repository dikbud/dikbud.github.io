<p>This is a simple 4-way Traffic Light Controller that I made. Traffic light ke code men apne dhiyan se dekha hoga to apko dikh raha hoga ki teen jagha par comment karke kuch likha gya he red led time ya yellow green led time or uske just samne likha hoga delay jske me kuch number likhen honge darasal bo jo men likha he bo us color ke led light ke on rehne ka time he agar ap cahe to us time ko apne anusar change kar sakte hen dhyan rahe ki. Its a pretty simple beginner project. ALL the way to the right. The circuit that we need to set up is really simple and shouldnt take you too long to do.</p>
