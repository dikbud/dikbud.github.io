<p><strong>Ipad Mini 2 Still Worth It</strong>. Ive been using the iPad Mini 2 for about a couple of months now and I have to say its extremely fast and works perfectly fast with every single game and applications I. Just bought my 4 year old an iPad Mini 4 from Apples Refurb Store. Unsurprisingly the most valuable iPad on the list is the largest and the newest. The Bottom Line It lacks the features and speed of a cutting-edge iPad but the Mini 2 is still a solid tablet for basics especially if you can buy it at a discount.</p>

A 64GB LTE iPad Air 2 is worth 270considerably less than the 729 you most likely paid for it not long ago. This is the n-1 strategy. The iPad mini is back. Both the iPad Mini and the iPad Mini 2 are the same size at 79 inches. Besides doubling the score of an iPad 4 iPhone 5.</p>

The iPad mini 2 is a last-generation tablet but is it still worth buying in todays market. The one place you wont find a good deal is Apples refurbished store which still sells the iPad Mini 2 for an exaggerated price.</p>
