<p><strong>Itachi Vs Kisame</strong>. To say Itachis seen his huge techs like the KisameSamehada merge waterdome and Daikodan is a pretty baseless assumption. Plus Samehada has the ability to give chakra as well so Itachi with a Samehada user covers all bases. It isnt one sided in itachis favor in any way. On the other hand itachi has no counter to water dome or great shark missile and would technically lose if kisame uses either one of them.</p>
