<p>Not a very high PSRR. The IC by itself can deliver an output current of 150mA and the maximum input voltage to the IC is 40V. Power Supply with LM723. Power supply circuit has a DC output voltage that can be regulated output from 0V up to 35V and it also depends on the input voltage. However we can increase the current limit up to 10 Ampere by using external transistors. So a 3 Amp Fuse on the Output would be a Good Idea.</p>

<p>With the Values Shown It is Adjustable from 3 to 30 Volts and 0 to 3 Amps. Make a power supply circuit using IC LM723 adjustable regulator is very nice to use the power supply that requires a large voltage-ampere. Here well try to understand how to construct a simplest power supply circuit using the IC LM317. So it is a small laboratory DC Power Supply at an inexpensive cost. The integrated voltage regulator LM723 will supply 150 mA of output currents but any desired load current can be provided by adding external transistors for output currents in excess of 10A. The ripple on C7 is far smaller than the ripple on C4 and also the DC level is higer as say 2-Ampere load so if de mains voltage is not to low i can still have a clean 20V output at 2-Ampere current.</p>

Also It is a high-efficiency regulator using an IC regulator UA723 and power transistor TIP3055. Ll Use the power transformer should be at least 5 amps and 36 volts AC output voltage. D4 and C7 makes a clean Power supply for the LM723 and the current source around Q4 that is used for the current limiting. If you want top performance you need to supply a separate ripple free supply for the error amp V.</p>
