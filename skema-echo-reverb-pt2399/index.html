One of the more popular of those is the Princeton Technology PT2399 but it comes with something of a snag for the experimenter in the form of a sparse data sheet. PT2399 frequency response within the limits of about 5kHz and when the input signal when the frequency is higher than 4kHz sine wave input signal will become somewhat similar to the triangle wave and in the input signal frequency is greater than 5kHz it will produce distortion and digital noise. The Delay effect as the name implies is obtained by delay echoes.</p>
