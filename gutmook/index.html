<p>You cant use spells and he outpaces you with minions sho you can never gain board control and can never damage his face. There just doesnt seem to be a way. I loved beating this guy with fatigue. The strategy for beating Metabolized Magic is similar to that of beating Digest Magic. This also helps you go wide against Xol to not lose against random mind control recycle. Not drafting for a single cthun or have enough earlygame pressure to beat Azari.</p>

<p>On levels 6 and 7 Gutmook uses Metabolized Magic. Dont draft a deck thats too reliant on playing spells or you will lose to Gutmook. Typically roguelikes contain a fantasy-themed narrative influenced heavily by table-top RPG predecessors such as Dungeons Dragons. I loose to it more than any other Dungeon Run boss because it keeps poping up after I make spell-heavy decks. This page was last edited on 5 April 2021 at 0017.</p>
