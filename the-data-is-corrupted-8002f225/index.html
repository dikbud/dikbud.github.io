<p>It worked great for about 2 years of use but eventually I started seeing disk errors the system resetlost file saves a number of times. The data is corrupted 8002F2C5 error any ideias. Data corrupted error code 8002F2C5 means the ps3 is not in 355 fw. I tried to install a font and i ended up having to downgrade to 355 again. A while back I bought a Phat PS3 on 355 OFW. After that I saved the PS3UPDATPUP file to a USB drive exactly the way the guide said to and put it into my PS3 containing the new hard drive.</p>
